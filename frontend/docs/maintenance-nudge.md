## âœ… When to Update `repo-map.txt`
| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Any folder/file structure change beyond minor tweaks | Regenerate with `tree -L 3 -I '.git|node_modules' > repo-map.txt`. |
| Before handover to collaborators | Ensure repo-map reflects current state. |

## âœ… Weekly Reminder (Can automate with o3 or Manus later)
- [ ] Run `git status` and ensure no forgotten changes.
- [ ] Check all READMEs & repo-map reflect current structure.
- [ ] Confirm CTA & site navigation flows are up to date.
- [ ] Review any deployable frontend changes (Hexagram Myth, MHCIC).
- [ ] Update `/docs/` if lore or structural documentation has changed.
