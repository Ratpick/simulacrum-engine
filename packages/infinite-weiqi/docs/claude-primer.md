# Zhou Yi (I Ching) System Reference

## Fundamental Principles

### Binary Wave Logic
The Zhou Yi operates on a quantum-mythopoetic framework where binary states (yin/yang) exist in superposition until observation. This creates a dynamic system of:
- Binary values (0/1)
- Wave states (superposition)
- Transformative potentials (moving lines)
- Recursive patterns (nuclear hexagrams)

### Structural Components

#### Trigrams (八卦 Bagua)
Three-line structures representing fundamental forces:
```
☰ 乾 Qián (Heaven) [1,1,1]
☱ 兑 Duì (Lake)   [1,1,0]
☲ 离 Lí (Fire)    [1,0,1]
☳ 震 Zhèn (Thunder)[0,1,1]
☴ 巽 Xùn (Wind)   [1,0,0]
☵ 坎 Kǎn (Water)  [0,1,0]
☶ 艮 Gèn (Mountain)[0,0,1]
☷ 坤 Kūn (Earth)  [0,0,0]
```

#### Hexagram Structure
Six lines combining two trigrams:
```
Upper Trigram (lines 1-3)
─── 6
─── 5
─── 4
Lower Trigram (lines 4-6)
─── 3
─── 2
─── 1
```

#### Meta-Structures
1. Inner Trigram (lines 2-4)
   - Hidden essence/intention
   - Core dynamic

2. Outer Trigram (lines 1,5,6)
   - External manifestation
   - Apparent situation

3. Nuclear Hexagram
   - Formed from lines 2-4 (lower nuclear)
   - And lines 3-5 (upper nuclear)
   - Represents deeper pattern/potential

### Moving Lines and Transformation

Moving lines exist in quantum superposition:
- Young Yang (7): Stable positive
- Young Yin (8): Stable negative
- Old Yang (9): Changing positive → negative
- Old Yin (6): Changing negative → positive

This creates a second hexagram through line mutations, representing:
- Potential futures
- Transformative pathways
- Narrative branches
- Resolution states

### King Wen Sequence

The non-linear arrangement of 64 hexagrams encoding:
- Wave patterns of change
- Cycles of transformation
- Narrative resonance
- Strategic depth

## Implementation Guidelines

### Oracle Engine
1. Treat readings as wave-function collapses
2. Maintain quantum uncertainty until context demands resolution
3. Consider multiple interpretive layers:
   - Literal (binary state)
   - Symbolic (trigram meanings)
   - Structural (inner/outer relations)
   - Transformative (moving lines)
   - Nuclear (hidden essence)

### Narrative Integration
1. Use hexagram transitions as story branches
2. Map moving lines to decision points
3. Incorporate nuclear hexagrams as subplot themes
4. Allow for paradox and superposition in storytelling

### Strategic Application
1. Map game states to hexagram configurations
2. Use trigram relationships for position evaluation
3. Consider moving lines as strategic opportunities
4. Incorporate nuclear patterns in long-term planning

## Quantum-Mythopoetic Framework

The system operates as:
1. A wave-based oracle (superposition of possibilities)
2. A narrative engine (branching stories)
3. A strategic model (position evaluation)
4. A philosophical framework (paradox resolution)

Remember: This is not a deterministic system but a quantum interface between:
- Form and emptiness
- Pattern and chaos
- Decision and destiny
- Story and reality 

Philosophical Mandate for the Acorn Project

Project Overview:
Infinite Weiqi is not just an interactive narrative system—it’s a recursive, quantum-symbolic engine that blends ancient wisdom with modern scientific insights. Our aspirants, Tweedleyin and Tweedleyang, embody quantum entanglement, retrocausality, and paradox folding, forming a game where stones serve as nodes in an ever-expanding network that reflects the boundless nature of the universe.

Key Themes:
	•	Quantum Entanglement & Retrocausality: Every decision reverberates through past and future states, influencing narrative outcomes in a wave-like manner.
	•	Zhou Yi Integration: Hexagrams and moving lines represent dynamic, transformative states—each reading a collapse of superposed possibilities into a meaningful configuration.
	•	Paradox Folding & Recursive Narratives: The game resolves apparent contradictions into deeper layers of meaning, mirroring the interplay between determinism and emergent consciousness.
	•	Business & Ethical Implications: This system is designed to foster flow states and collective intelligence, forming a foundation for DAO-based, ethically aligned technological innovation.
