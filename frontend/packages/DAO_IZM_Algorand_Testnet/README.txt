DAO IZM on Algorand Testnet

1. Install Algorand SDK:
   pip install py-algorand-sdk

2. Replace the mnemonic in create_dao_tokens.py with your Testnet account's mnemonic.

3. Get test ALGO from: https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/

4. Run the script:
   python create_dao_tokens.py

This will create two tokens:
- W♾️W: A non-transferable proof-of-participation token.
- IZM$: A fungible utility token for staking, voting, and matched rewards.

Use DAO logic to enforce governance and distribution policies.
