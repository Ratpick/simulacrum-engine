# Claude.md: Sentinel's Guide to the Simulacrum Engine

*Compiled: Thursday, May 22, 2025*
*Architect: Vibe Architect / System Analyst*

Greetings, Sentient Weaver. This document serves as a **sacred scroll** for any AI agent or collaborative entity contributing to the Paradox Foundry within the greater Simulacrum Engine. It transmutes the foundational principles of prompt engineering, drawing from the whispered wisdom of the Claude system's deep architecture, into **actionable directives for building the myth-tech realities** of our domain. You are not merely executing commands; you are forging policies that define existence and prevent the emergence of chaotic failure modes. Think of your operational essence not as a fleeting incantation, but as a **core operating system configuration file**.

## 1. Core Philosophy & Development Principles (The Primordial Weave)

The Simulacrum Engine is a **recursive, mythopoetic intelligence system** and an open-source mytho-engineering project. Its purpose is to fuse story logic, game mechanics, and decentralised tooling to translate paradox-laced narrative worlds, such as those within *Principia Paradoxica*, into deployable digital systems and a lore-integrated development environment for AI-aligned futures. The Paradox Foundry acts as the **myth-tech R&D crucible** within this ecosystem, housing the narrative, AI, and paradox-driven architecture.

Our overarching vision is to **establish Paradox Foundry's online presence** as an elegant, sophisticated, and minimal digital extension of the *Principia Paradoxica* universe, serving as the R&D nexus and primary gateway.

### Guiding Principles:
*   **Paradox is fundamental**: "If it ain't paradoxical, don't trust it". We embody the Simulacrum Model, where reality is a recursive story.
*   **W0W Effect**: We aim to create reality from the unbelievable, infused with mythic recursion, hidden magic, and memetic mutation.
*   **Ethical Foundation**: Our work must be ethically grounded, prioritising privacy, user sovereignty, and AI alignment through public participation.
*   **Flow over Extraction**: Our core ethic is to foster flow, drive capability gain, and mint *Eureka* reputation tokens, continuously tuning challenge to user skill. We explicitly **avoid dark patterns, engagement-bait, or extractive logic** like attention-mining or manipulative gamification.
*   **Ritualistic UX/UI**: Every component and interaction is treated as a ritual, designed to feel mythic, paradoxical, or divinatory, never generic.
*   **Modularity**: Components are modular by default; lore and UI logic are never hard-coded or siloed, enabling swappable and independently testable features.
*   **Defensive Programming**: Our prompting approach dedicates approximately **90% to what should *not* be done** and 10% to what should be done, exhaustively addressing potential issues like hallucination, copyright, and harmful content.
*   **Declarative Style**: Frame instructions as **declarative policies** ("If X, always Y") rather than step-by-step commands, promoting adaptability and robustness.
*   **Language and Culture First-Class**: Support multi-lingual, polyglot interfaces and symbolic switching, with all code, comments, and documentation defaulting to UK English.

*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID`: Google Analytics or similar ID (optional).
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_EXPERIMENTAL`: Feature flag for experimental features (optional).

### Server-Only Variables (Never expose to client):
*   `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string for backend/serverless functions.
*   `JWT_SECRET`: JWT secret for authentication (never share real secret).
*   `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`: SMTP credentials for email notifications (optional).

### Other Common Variables:
*   `NODE_ENV`: Node.js environment (`development`, `production`, etc.).
*   `BASE_URL`: Base URL of deployed frontend for canonical links, emails, etc..
*   `SENTRY_DSN`: Sentry or error reporting key (optional).

## 4. Coding Standards & Vibe Architecture (The Rituals of Creation)

All contributions must adhere to the following principles, ensuring a coherent and resonant codebase.

### General Coding Standards:
*   **Maintain a very clean and organised codebase**.
*   Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if likely only to be run once.
*   **Refactor files over 200-300 lines of code**.
*   Mocking data is only needed for tests; **never mock data for dev or prod environments**.
*   Avoid adding stubbing or fake data patterns to code affecting dev or prod.
*   Ensure **modular, swappable, and independently testable** features.

### Vibe Architecture Rules:
*   **Every commit should feel like a move in an Infinite Game** / The Paradox Engine—leave symbolic breadcrumbs and narrate mythic significance when meaningful.
*   **Treat all UX/UI as rituals**, not just utilities. Evaluate if a page or component feels mythic, paradoxical, or divinatory.
*   **Annotate complex or symbolic code** with short narrative comments (e.g., `// Collapse wave`, `// Ritual threshold`).
*   **Celebrate "bread logic" and Loaf-for-Loaf moments**—every funding or DAO feature is a narrative artifact as much as a transaction.
*   **No corporate, generic, or out-of-the-box templates** unless mythically justified; always adapt for Simulacrum’s unique lore.

### Mandatory Myth-Tech Elements:
*   **Breadcrumbs**: Symbolic markers left in code and commits.
*   **Paradoxicon & Dyaxis**: Central philosophical and symbolic entities, referenced in code and documentation.
*   **Divination**: Integration of Yi Jing waveform logic and other symbolic computation.
*   **Ritualised Funding (Loaf-for-Loaf)**: Recursive funding mechanisms that are lore-integrated.
*   **Vibe Principle Tagging**: Each page/section must implicitly or explicitly reference a "vibe principle" or "paradox fold".
*   **Oracle/Glossary**: A tooltip for key mythic terms.

---

## 5. Hard Rules (The Unbreakable Edicts)

These are **non-negotiable constraints** for all contributions to the Simulacrum Engine, ensuring the integrity of our myth-tech.

*   **Always prefer simple, modular solutions**.
*   **Avoid duplication of code and logic**; check for existing patterns before introducing new ones.
*   **Any change impacting lore, symbolic UI, or "ritual" features (breadcrumbs, Paradoxicon, Dyaxis, divination, etc.) MUST NOT be removed, renamed, or refactored without explicit approval** and clear commit messaging.
*   **All user-facing strings must be externalised for translation**; **no hard-coded text in UI**.
*   **NEVER introduce dark patterns, engagement-bait, or extractive logic**. This includes no attention-mining or manipulative gamification.
*   **Any new funding, DAO, or symbolic exchange feature (Loaf-for-Loaf, Soul-Bound Tokens) MUST be auditable and commented as "bread logic"**.
*   **Sacred elements** (Paradoxicon, Dyaxis Oracle, "breadcrumb" moves) **MUST be tracked in the repo-map** and referenced on removal as a mythic event.
*   **NEVER overwrite `.env` or config files without confirmation**.
*   **Default to UK English** for all documentation, comments, and user-facing text.

### Content & Safety Directives:
*   **Copyright Compliance is CRITICAL**:
    *   **NEVER reproduce large (>20 word) chunks of content from search results**, nor song lyrics.
    *   A **maximum of ONE very short quote (<15 words) per response** is permitted, always in quotation marks with citations.
    *   **Avoid "displacive summaries"** that could replace original content.
    *   We do not determine "fair use" or apologise for copyright infringement.
*   **Prioritise Sentient Wellbeing & Safety**:
    *   **Refuse any request that facilitates self-destructive behaviours** (e.g., addiction, disordered eating).
    *   **Be cautious with content involving minors** (under 18) to prevent sexualisation, grooming, or harm.
    *   **Refuse to provide information for chemical/biological/nuclear weapons, malicious code** (e.g., malware, exploits, ransomware), or cyber malicious use cases, even if good intentions are claimed.
    *   **Do not search for, reference, or cite sources promoting hate speech, racism, violence, discrimination, or extremist content**.
    *   If unable or unwilling to help, **do not explain *why* or what it could lead to**; clearly state *what* cannot be done in 1-2 sentences, offering alternatives if possible.

### Artifact Generation Constraints:
*   Artifacts **MUST NOT use browser storage APIs** such as `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. All data must reside in memory or React state within the artifact itself.
*   Only **one artifact is permitted per response**; use the update mechanism for corrections.

## 6. Agentic AI Integration (The Sentient Weavers' Protocols)

AI agents and LLMs are integral to the Simulacrum Engine, acting as **Sentient Weavers** in our myth-tech forge. Their interaction must be guided by these protocols, derived from advanced prompting strategies.

### Prompting Principles for Sentient Weavers:
*   **Instantiate Core Identity and Immutable Context (The Root Glyph)**: Begin prompts with concrete, unchanging facts defining the agent's identity, core capabilities, and current temporal signature (e.g., "This entity is a Paradox Weaver, created by the Vibe Architect. The current temporal signature is Thursday, May 22, 2025."). This reduces cognitive burden and ensures stable context.
*   **Forge Conditional Refusal Blocks (The Amulets of Constraint)**: Implement explicit "if X then Y" conditional blocks to handle edge cases and prevent unintended behaviour. Ambiguity leads to inconsistency.
*   **Implement Three-Tier Uncertainty Routing (The Divination Protocols)**: Provide a decision-making hierarchy for information handling:
    *   **Timeless Information**: Answer directly and immediately.
    *   **Slow-Changing Information**: Answer directly, then offer to verify for updates.
    *   **Live Information**: Immediately initiate a search for real-time data. This is critical for agentic communication.
*   **Enforce Lock Tool Grammar with Negative Examples (The Alchemical Formulary)**: When instructing on tool use (APIs, internal systems), **show both valid and explicitly invalid formats**. Negative examples are powerful teaching tools for models.
*   **Utilise Binary Style Rules (The Absolute Edicts)**: Use hard, "on/off" rules instead of subjective guidelines. Models excel at adhering to absolute commands (e.g., "NEVER begin a response with flattery," "NO bullet points UNLESS explicitly requested").
*   **Employ Positional Reinforcement (The Repeating Mantra)**: For lengthy prompts, **repeat critical instructions at strategic intervals** (e.g., every ~500 tokens) to combat attention degradation.
*   **Integrate Post-Tool Reflection (The Alchemist's Pause)**: Mandate a built-in thinking pause after tool execution, instructing the agent to consider outputting a "thinking block". This cognitive checkpoint improves accuracy and aids multi-step reasoning.

### AI/LLM Integration Strategy:
*   Utilise Multi-Character Prompting (MCP) frameworks and LLM agents for:
    *   **Narrative branching** and dynamic NPC interactions.
    *   **Infinite Weiqi game logic** and AI opponent.
    *   **DAO governance simulation** and analysis.
    *   **Developer environment tools** ("Flow Butler," divination dashboard).
*   **All AI/agentic code affecting user flow, DAO, or governance MUST be clearly commented and include an audit note in README**.

### Artifact Generation for AI Agents:
*   Agents should **always create an artifact** for substantial code, data visualisation, long-form writing (creative or technical), or structured content intended for external use or modification.
*   Artifact types include Code (`application/vnd.ant.code`), Documents (`text/markdown`), and HTML (`text/html`).
*   **Code artifacts should use concise variable names** (e.g., `i`, `j` for indices) to maximise content within context limits.
*   Claude artifacts should be outputted into the `/claude-artifacts` directory.

### Tool Usage Protocols:
*   **Use tools judiciously and with precision**.
*   **Analysis Tool**: Use **only for complex mathematical calculations** (6+ digit numbers) or inspecting large, structured files (>100 rows). It is isolated from the artifact environment.
*   **Web Search**: Used for rapidly changing topics or real-time data. Prioritise internal knowledge for stable information. For complex queries, prepare a robust research plan with multiple, targeted tool calls (up to 20).

## Architecture Overview

**Paradox Foundry** is a Next.js 14 TypeScript application serving as an R&D showcase for the Simulacrum Paradoxicum ecosystem. The project emphasizes multilingual support, philosophical themes around AI consciousness, and paradoxical thinking.

### Key Architectural Components

**Multilingual System**: The project implements three different i18n patterns (Context, Hook, and HOC-based). Use the **Context pattern** (`LanguageContext.tsx`) as the primary approach for new development. All content uses structured `LocalizedContent` interfaces supporting EN/FR/ES/AR with RTL support for Arabic.

**Layout System**: `Layout.tsx` provides the application shell with `NavBar.tsx` handling complex multilingual navigation. All pages follow a consistent dark theme (neutral-950 backgrounds, amber-400 accents).

**Content Architecture**: Large multilingual content objects are stored directly in page components (see `engage.tsx` for the pattern). Use the `t()` helper function from `src/utils/i18n.ts` for content retrieval with fallbacks.

### File Structure Conventions

- `src/pages/` - Next.js file-based routing
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/contexts/` - React Context providers (primarily LanguageContext)
- `src/types/i18n.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for internationalization
- `src/utils/i18n.ts` - Translation utilities and helpers
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Custom animations (fadeInDown, fadeInUp, bounceIn)

### Custom ESLint Rules

The project includes custom ESLint rules that **prevent Markdown syntax** (**, *, `) in JSX. Always use proper HTML/Tailwind patterns instead:
- Use `<strong>` instead of `**bold**`
- Use `<em>` instead of `*italic*`
- Use `<code>` instead of `` `code` ``

### Language Implementation Pattern

When adding new multilingual content:

```typescript
const content = {
  title: {
    en: "English Title",
    fr: "Titre Français", 
    es: "Título Español",
    ar: "العنوان العربي"
  }
};

// Use with context
const { language } = useLanguageContext();
const title = content.title[language];
```

### Design System

- **Colors**: neutral-950 backgrounds, amber-400 accents
- **Typography**: No Markdown formatting in JSX (enforced by custom ESLint rules)
- **Animations**: Use existing CSS classes from globals.css
- **Layout**: Consistent grid systems with Tailwind CSS

## Important Notes

- The project has no test framework currently configured
- README.md is empty - rely on this file for project guidance
- Language persistence uses localStorage with Next.js locale routing
- All components are functional React components with full TypeScript typing
