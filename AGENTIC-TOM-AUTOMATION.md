# Paradox Foundry / Simulacrum Engine: Extended Project Specification

## üåê Project Overview
*Paradox Foundry* powers the Principia Paradoxica universe‚Äîa sci-fantasy trilogy and frontier tech ecosystem. Our goal is to fuse recursive narrative design, agentic Theory of Mind (ToM), and decentralised, ethical AI‚Äîdelivering the Paradox Engine, a next-gen narrative/game/AI platform.

## üß† Agentic Theory of Mind Studio

- **Purpose:**  
  To design, develop, and orchestrate truly *agentic* AI‚Äîentities with dynamic beliefs, desires, and ethical self-awareness.  
  Our ToM Studio is where recursive, empathetic, and dialectical AI is born‚Äîinfused with philosophical and mythopoeic principles.

- **Scope & Functionality:**  
  - Develop reusable, open-source ToM modules for use in games, simulations, DAOs, and creative AI.
  - Enable emergent, ‚Äúliving‚Äù NPCs, adaptive gameplay, and deep narrative branching.
  - Integrate Bayesian, dialectical, and neurosymbolic frameworks for ethical, context-aware AI reasoning.

- **Key Technologies:**  
  - Python-based agent frameworks: LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Smolagents, etc.
  - Multimodal logic: Bayesian inference, neurosymbolic hybrids, and probabilistic programming.

## üîó n8n: Orchestration & Automation Engine

- **Purpose:**  
  To serve as the meta-orchestrator‚Äîrapidly connecting, automating, and evaluating all agentic, AI, and system workflows.

- **Key Uses:**  
  - Build data pipelines for training/evaluation of ToM agents.
  - Orchestrate complex workflows across microservices (Python, Node.js, etc), DAOs, and narrative/game engines.
  - Automate integration with external APIs, blockchain, and analytics.
  - Enable ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù and recursive dev: *the automation glue for a living R&D lab*.

## ü§ñ Python & Agentic Frameworks

- **Agentic AI:**  
  - Python-first orchestration of agents, narrative bots, and DAOs.
  - Integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, and custom LLMs for advanced ToM simulation.
  - Hybrid logic for AI/ML pipelines, analytics, and automation.

- **Key Frameworks:**  
  - LangGraph (multi-agent orchestration)
  - CrewAI (autonomous agent teams)
  - AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Smolagents (modular, composable agent logic)
  - n8n (for Python/Node automation & orchestration)

## üé≤ Paradox Engine (Infinite Weiqi) & AI@home

- **How ToM/N8n Empower Core Products:**  
  - *Paradox Engine* (formerly Infinite Weiqi):  
    - All branching, stateful, and emergent gameplay is driven by ToM-powered agents and Bayesian logic.
    - I Ching/Zhou Yi principles provide narrative/game branching‚ÄîToM agents reason recursively about change and uncertainty.
    - n8n automates game logic, player‚ÄìAI interactions, and content generation pipelines.

  - *AI@home*:  
    - Distributed, agentic AI trained and orchestrated via ToM Studio and n8n.
    - Empathetic, anticipatory, and ethically-aligned AI in real-world and simulated environments.

## üåç DAO IZM, W‚àûW, and Ecosystem Roles

- **DAO IZM:**  
  - Agentic, ToM-powered analytics for governance, grant allocation, and ethical compliance.
  - n8n handles off-chain automation, on-chain smart contract integration, and real-time DAO interactions.

- **W‚àûW Credentials:**  
  - ToM agents issue and evaluate ‚Äúsoul-bound tokens‚Äù for both human and AI actors.

- **Ecosystem-wide:**  
  - Agentic workflows extend across research, grant compliance, reporting, and open innovation.
  - All code, data, and workflows to be open and reusable for the global community.

---

## üí° Why This Matters

- **Not just another platform.**  
  - The *Agentic ToM Studio* is a world-first: agentic, ethically-aligned, mythopoeic AI for real and virtual worlds.
  - Immediate grant-readiness, public benefit, and IP defensibility.
  - Join us to build the future of living AI, collective intelligence, and recursive narrative reality.
