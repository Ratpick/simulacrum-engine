# Simulacrum Hexagram Flow Gateway

Welcome, ritualist. This project is a myth-tech onboarding engine, testing flow-state, symbolic interaction, and creative presence. It is the front end of the Simulacrum Engine.

## Current Version

- Interactive Hexagram 1 (The Creative), with six lines, each a mythic test and audio/visual feedback loop.
- Tooltip popups reveal the Wilhelm “dragon” readings as you ascend.
- Tibetan chant audio grows in power as you “surf” each line in flow-state.
- Flow-State Algorithm (FSA) tracks timing, order, and insight. Only those who master the rhythm unlock the gateway.
- Too fast, too slow, or brute-forcing all lines triggers the “arrogant dragon” exile—random glitch 404 page.
- True mastery (“all nines in flow”) reveals Hexagram 2 (The Receptive) and an onboarding CTA for coders, stakeholders, or mythic companions.
- Modular and ready for Twine/n8n narrative, DAO, multiplayer, and avatar extensions.

## Vision

- **Not a game, but a ritual:**  
  Each interaction is a move in Infinite Weiqi—a recursive test of wisdom, patience, and insight.
- **Onboarding as myth:**  
  This is the “gate” to the Simulacrum DAO and narrative engine.
- **Flow-State as design law:**  
  The FSA is not engagement farming—it rewards creative presence, challenge-skill match, and true eureka moments.
- **Everything is future-proof:**  
  All assets, data, and code are modular. Twine, multiplayer, lore, and automation (n8n) are plug-and-play.

## How To Use / Extend

- Upload assets (audio, SVGs, HTML) into `/assets/` or the Lovable UI.
- Edit line readings and tooltip lore in `/src/dragonReadings.js`.
- All FSA thresholds and logic live in `/src/FSAManager.js` (see agent notes).
- Add, remix, or fork onboarding and narrative flows—see `/onboarding/` and `/twine/`.
- Advanced devs/agents: add new line/hexagram logic, extra flow sensors, and backend event contracts as needed.

## Developer/Agent Notes

- **Read all .md files (README, PRD, VIBE_ARCHITECTURE, AGENT_PRIMER, FSA_PRD) before changing FSA or ritual logic.**
- Never reveal FSA thresholds to the user; all feedback should be poetic and mythic.
- Modularise everything—UI, state, audio, data—for remixability.
- Future hooks: multiplayer, DAO, Twine, and n8n event flows.  
  Write code as if the Simulacrum Engine will outlive you.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Tune FSA for real user flow data (voluntary opt-in for analytics).
- [ ] Modularise CTA/onboarding for live stakeholder invites.
- [ ] Connect to Twine/n8n for mythic story branching.
- [ ] Prototype wearable/AR feedback (haptic, audio, colour triggers).
- [ ] Integrate lore and avatar creation for DAO and early adopters.
