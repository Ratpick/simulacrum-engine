## AI/ML Workflow Standards

Paradox Foundry adopts and extends the [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) for agentic, automation-first, and reproducible AI/ML development.  
- See `/bmad-method` for base templates, workflows, and starter agents.
- All new AI/data projects should follow the BMAD workflow, unless otherwise noted.
