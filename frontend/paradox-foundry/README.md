# Paradox Foundry

**Paradox Foundry** is the myth-tech R&D crucible within the [Simulacrum Engine](../README.md) monorepo. It houses the narrative, AI, and paradox-driven architecture that powers the entire Simulacrum Paradoxicum ecosystem.

## ✨ Core Mission

Paradox Foundry serves as:
- The R&D and design nucleus for myth-tech and narrative AI systems
- The primary home of *The Paradox Engine*—an interactive narrative platform inspired by the I Ching, recursive game theory, and Vibe Architecture
- The forge for tools, Flow-State Algorithms (FSA), lore logic, and symbolic UX patterns that enable modular, multi-lingual, and ritualistic user experiences

## 🌀 Key Principles (Vibe Architecture)

- All components must serve both **narrative depth** and **collective intelligence**
- Modular by default; lore and UI logic are never hard-coded or siloed
- UX/UI is ritual: design and commit as if every change is a move in Infinite Weiqi
- Language and culture are first-class: support multi-lingual, polyglot interfaces and symbolic switching
- All code, comments, and documentation default to UK English

## 🧩 Folder Structure

- `/src` – Main source code for Paradox Foundry frontend (pages, components, contexts)
- `/claude-artifacts` – Claude Code, system prompts, and artifact output
- `/public` – Static assets, logos, symbolic diagrams
- `/README.md` – You are here

## 🔮 Integration with Simulacrum Engine

- FSA, Zoan, DAO IZM, Mariem’s Heart, and other myth-tech experiments plug in here
- All symbolic logic (breadcrumbs, Paradoxicon, Dyaxis, ritualised funding) should reference Vibe Architecture global rules

## 🛠️ Development Principles

- Always prefer simple, modular solutions
- Avoid duplication—check for similar code and patterns elsewhere in the monorepo
- No hard-coded UI text—use translation layer
- Every commit is a symbolic move (leave breadcrumbs in commit messages)
- Respect .env and config files; never overwrite without confirmation
- All new features must be modular, swappable, and independently testable
