Coding Pattern Preferences (Acorn Project)

Simplicity & Elegance
	•	Write clear, minimal code that mirrors the simplicity and elegance of a trigram.
	•	Every function should be as succinct and resonant as a well-ordered hexagram.

Avoid Redundancy
	•	Prevent duplication by reviewing the codebase for similar patterns before adding new logic.
	•	Consolidate and refactor to maintain a harmonious structure.

Environmental Awareness
	•	Ensure that code behaves correctly in development, testing, and production environments without introducing uncertainty.

Mindful Modification
	•	Only implement changes when they are requested or fully understood.
	•	Avoid introducing new abstractions or technologies until the existing implementation has been thoroughly explored; remove outdated patterns to keep the codebase clean.

Clean and Organized Structure
	•	Maintain a modular codebase with files ideally under 200–300 lines.
	•	Refactor as needed to preserve clarity and structural integrity.

Data Integrity
	•	Use real, consistent data for development and production; reserve mocking solely for testing purposes.
	•	Never include temporary stubs or fake data in live environments.

Respect for Configuration
	•	Do not overwrite critical configuration files (like .env) without explicit confirmation.
	•	These files are the sacred vessels of the project’s continuity.
